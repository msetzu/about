<i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> 2015 -- 2016  | <i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i> Cagliari, IT
- Developed the first version of [Code Ontology](http://codeontology.org/about), a comprehensive framework of ontologies,  datsets and knowledge extractors targeting the Web of Code.
- Developed the Code Ontology [website](http://codeontology.org/) and [query endpoint](http://codeontology.org/sparql).
- Published research findings on the _ICSC16_, and accessed the final phase of the [SIGMOD/PODS 2016 Undergraduate competition](http://sigmod2016.org/sigmod_undergraduate_list.shtml).

### Skills & tools
I'm proficient in **Java** and **Python**, which I used for most of my developing experience, _Code Ontology_ and reports included. The former allowed me to experiment with code parsing ([spoon](http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/)) and **OWL** technologies ([protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/), [Apache Jena/Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/index.html) and [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/)), while several of the latter were written in Latex, some in Markdown. Data-oriented projects heavily relied on **MATLAB** and the python data scientist tools: **numpy**, **sklearn**, **pandas** analysis-wise, and **keras** on the learning-side.

My back-end and front-end development involved **Code Igniter**, **Laravel**, **Bootstrap**, and a brief overlook of the Google Hangouts API.


My develop setup includes version control (**git**), virtual machines (**vagrant**) and UNIX utilities.

### Interests & extra-curricular activities
What more than that? I'm intrigued by the startup world and its ability to change at an incredible pace. I participated in several related events: the **Startup Weekend 2015** and **2016** held in Cagliari; the [Semantic Web and Open Data seminar](http://people.unica.it/massimodifrancesco/2016/02/26/seminari-su-semantic-web-and-open-data-2/), where I briefly introduced _Code Ontology_ to the faculty's corpus and students; the [Cagliari Open Data Day 2016](http://opendata.regione.sardegna.it/eventi/cagliari-open-data-day-2016-iv-edizione) and the [Contamination Lab](http://clabunica.it/) held by the Università degli Studi di Cagliari.

While in Pisa I attended several [seminars on the ICT industry](https://www.di.unipi.it/en/17-education/1088-research-innovation-and-future-of-ict) and I'm currently pursuing the [PhD+ program](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/phd-plus).
