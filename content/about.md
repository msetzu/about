I'm Mattia Setzu, a Ph. D. student in Computer Science. My research focuses on Explainable AI (XAI) and its applications in Fair Machine Learning (FairML).
Currently, the topics I'm working on are
- Local to Global explainability
- Controlling models with explainably fair constraints
- Sequence models explainability
