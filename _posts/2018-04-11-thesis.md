The **local 2 global** problem is a data-starved generalization problem. Data-starved problems aim to generalize local models to the larger input space through the use of oracles and adversarial algorithms. 



### Definition

Formally we can set our problems as follows. Given a set of local models \\(m_1, \dots, m_l​\\) defined on a set of local samples \\(S = \{S_1, \dots, S_l\} \in I^l\\), we define a local 2 global problem as the search of a model \\(m​\\) on \\(TS\\) s.t. the error \\(\mathcal{E}\\) over a global \\(TS​\\) set is minimized:

​						$$P := arg\min\limits_{m} \mathcal{E} (m, TS)$$.

State of the art solutions attack the problem by using ensembles ([ATM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05390), [Random Forests](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324)), generative models ([BCM](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5313-the-bayesian-case-model-a-generative-approach-for-case-based-reasoning-and-prototype-classification)) and genetic algorithms ([G-REX](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362546X96002672)) to emulate the input distribution \\(D_I\\) and reduce the problem to a known machine learning model.



### Why target local data?

Data locality is not necessarily detrimental to the user of the model: highly specific problems do not suffer from the reduction in input locality, while they can be negatively impacted by a train set unnecessarily large for their goal. Such is the case for outliers and noisy training data, which tends to lead the model astray from its target function. Even more widespread is the actual _lack_ of well-distributed data.

On one hand research effort focused on creating performant generative and adversarial approaches to generalize the local data, while on the other hand enriching local models by providing clear-box explanations for black-box models ([LIME](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2939778)). The two approaches are not mutually exclusive and can be applied to achieve both interpretability and performance.


### Explainability

As AI grows in efficiency and spread, so does its impact on complex, multi-faceted issues, with ethics and economy trumping the others. It is not our purpose to assess the AI's economic potential, the recent [\\($3\\) billion evaluation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-09/sensetime-snags-alibaba-funding-at-a-record-3-billion-valuation) of the machine vision company [*SenseTime*](https://www.sensetime.com/) should speak by itself.
Given these huge investments, we can identify three actors in play:

- **companies** investing in understanding their AI systems in order to comply with regulations and achieve a solid return;
- **governments** investing in protecting the citizens' rights and prevent discrimination;
- **citizens** worried about discrimination and job disruption, aiming to get good and fair products to power their decisions.

*The actors' triangle: citizens demand fairness through legislation; governments apply regulation through inspection, incentivizing the growth of explainable systems; businesses comply in order to increase output and revenues, empowering citizens*.

A tripartite framework of Business, Users, and Governments (BUG, ironically) hinging on the ability of the _super-partes_ actor ability to inspect. Hence it is desirable to build a set of explanation tools able to accomplish careful inspections both on the ethical and the economic point of view.

The European Union is moving in this direction and has been developing the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/) (GDPR), expected to be enforced from the `25 May 2018`.


### Research

I joined Professors [Dino Pedreschi](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/pedreschi-dino), [Franco Turini](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/turini-franco), [Anna Monreale](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/monreale-anna) and [Guidotti Riccardo](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/riccardo-guidotti) in an effort to address both the explainability and globalization problem.

Wish us luck!
