In the past summer I have spent two months at Aarhus University to collaborate with the [Data Intensive System Group](https://cs.au.dk/research/data-intensive-systems/) led by [Prof. Ira Assent](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/ira-assent(012c1c28-bfa9-4107-bd8f-97dae008b06d).html). For the two months of my visit, I collaborated with [Simon Enni](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/simon-enni(1fae12ee-b01f-4473-88a1-ed9da81ce8a7).html).
Together we have developed an agnostic methodology for assessing the bias of a given dataset and uncover the underlying biases it may hold.

We'll link the paper and code of our methodology as soon as we submit it to a suitable venue.
