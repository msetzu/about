The **local 2 global** probelm is a data-starved generalization problem. Data-starved problems aim to generalize local models to the larger input space through the use of oracles and adversarial algorithms. 



### Definition

Formally we can set our problems as follows. Given a set of local models $m_1, \dots, m_l$ defined on a set of local samples $S = \{S_1, \dots, S_l\} \in I^l$, we define a local 2 global problem as the search of a model $m$ with predictions $m_{TS}$ on $TS$ s.t. the error $\varepsilon$ over a global $TS$ set is minimized:

â€‹						$P := arg\min\limits_{m} \mathbb{E} (m_{TS}, TS.target)$.

State of the art solutions attack the problem by using ensembles ([ATM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05390), [Random Forests](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324)), generative models ([BCM](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5313-the-bayesian-case-model-a-generative-approach-for-case-based-reasoning-and-prototype-classification)) and genetic algorithms ([G-REX](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362546X96002672)) to emulate the input distribution $D_I$ and reduce the problem to a known machine learning model.



### Why target local data?

Data locality is not necessarely detrimental to the user of the model: highly specific problems do not suffer from the reduction in input locality, while they can be negatively impacted by a train set unecessarily large for their goal. Such is the case for outliers and noisy training data, which tends to lead the model astray from its target function. Even more widespread is the actual _lack_ of well-distributed data.

On one hand research effort focused on creating performant generative and adversarial approaches to generalize the local data, while on the other hand enriching local models by providing clear-box explanations for black-box models ([LIME](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2939778)). The two approaches are not mutually-exclusive and can be applied to achieve both interpretability and performance.



### Research

I joined Professors [Dino Pedreschi](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/pedreschi-dino), [Franco Turini](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/turini-franco), [Anna Monreale](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/monreale-anna) and [Guidotti Riccardo](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/riccardo-guidotti) in an effort to combine the clear-box and globalization approaches and develop a system to address these problems.
